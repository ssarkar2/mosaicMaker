# mosaicMaker
Create a mosaic from images

Uses Python 2.7, numpy, scipy and wx (for GUI)

Given a folder of images, a mosaic is created out of them, with some intermediate steps in the mosaic for a fade in effect
Once the mosaic is ready, you can click on images from the mosaic to display them along with some stored caption (from caption.txt)
Press the close button or just click on the newly opened images to close them
The frame title keeps track of the number of unique images and how many have been discovered

See the __main__ section for all the parameters that can be tweaked
