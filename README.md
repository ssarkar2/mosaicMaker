# mosaicMaker
Create a mosaic from images

Uses Python 2.7, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and wx (for GUI)

Given a folder of images, a mosaic is created out of them, with some intermediate steps in the mosaic for a fade in effect
Once the mosaic is ready, you can click on images from the mosaic to display them along with some stored caption (from caption.txt)
Press the close button or just click on the newly opened images to close them

See the __main__ section for all the parameters that can be tweaked
